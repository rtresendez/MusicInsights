First, we need tidyverse to handle the data importing and wrangling
Since we already have it installed on this system we can go ahead and implement it.

```{r}

suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))

survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")

preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")

nrow(survey)
ncol(survey)
colnames(survey)
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "Generator_name"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?"  ] <- "pseudonym"

colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Which musical instruments/talents do you play? (Select all that apply)" ] <- "Instrument_pref"


colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "Year you were born (YYYY)"  ] <- "YOB"

parse_datetime(survey$Timestamp)




```
